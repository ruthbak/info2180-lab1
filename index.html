        <h2>Ruth Bakare</h2>
        <p>As a second-year computer science student, I have always been interested in all things 'tech' and how it drives innovation in our world. This has birthed my interest in web development and how websites assist business or people in general with creating beautiful, user-freindly websites that can positively impact users' lives. Additonally, the process of transforming ideas into code and then visually representing it through design is really exciting and I am passionate about enhacing my skills in this dynamic field.</p>
